# scss-extractor

Make sharing mixins, partials, and variables across web properties a breeze by effortlessly generating a shipable sass library for your design system.

Just give scss-extractor an entry point to sass code that is shared across multiple sites and it will extract your mixins, partials, and variables into a sass partial for inclusion in other builds.

This allows you to share precompiled core css across projects, while also providing a shared sass library.
